1. This week, I printed out the Github instructions from the course website and followed along carefully when setting everything up. I decided to print everything out because I found myself getting overwhelmed by the amount of webpages I had opened.
2. I followed the steps on the course website.
3. Obviously, I am submitting this assignment a few days late. I kept getting overwhelmed and giving up. I find GitHub to be very confusing. Once I printed out the step by step instructions, however, I was able to calm down and get everything working properly.
4. I would like to discuss GitHub itself more and learn more about how it is organized.
5. I did not communicate with my classmates this week.
